# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This folder contains Architecture Decision Records - a log of important technical decisions made during development.

## Why ADRs?

When you (or future you) wonder "why did we do it this way?", ADRs provide the answer. They capture:
- **Context**: What was the situation?
- **Decision**: What did we decide?
- **Consequences**: What are the tradeoffs?

## How to Use

1. Copy `000-template.md` to a new file
2. Number it sequentially (e.g., `001-database-choice.md`)
3. Fill out the template
4. Commit with your code changes
